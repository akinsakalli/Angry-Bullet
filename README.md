# Angry-Bullet
Angry Bullet is a simple 2D projectile motion game developed in Java using the StdDraw graphics library. This project was implemented as part of the coursework for CMPE160: Object Oriented Programming at Bogazici University during the Spring 2024 semester.

The objective of the game is to adjust the angle and velocity of a bullet to hit designated targets while avoiding a series of obstacles. The game demonstrates basic physics simulation, user interaction, and graphical rendering using Java.

Gameplay Instructions
Arrow Up / Down: Increase or decrease the shooting angle
Arrow Left / Right: Decrease or increase the initial velocity
Spacebar: Launch the projectile
R: Reset the game after a shot

If the projectile hits a target, a success message is displayed. If it hits an obstacle, the ground, or goes out of bounds, the player may retry by pressing R.
